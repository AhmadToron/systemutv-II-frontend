# React Installation Guide
To start an existing React app with an existing project and Node installation, follow these steps:
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your existing project.
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can check this by running the command node -v in your terminal. If Node.js is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Node.js website. https://nodejs.org/en/download
Once you have Node.js installed, run the command npm install in your project's root directory. This will install all the necessary dependencies for your React app.
After the installation is complete, you can start your React app by running the command npm start in your terminal. This will start the development server and open your app in a web browser.
Your existing React app should now be running with your existing project using Node installation.
